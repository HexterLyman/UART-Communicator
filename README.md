# UART Communication with EDAC and CRC

Implementation of UART Communication between 2 STM32 boards with added *Error Detection and Correction* (EDAC) and *Cyclic Redundancy Check* (CRC).  


## Overview
This project aims to simulate the communication process between a satellite and a ground station using 2 STM32 boards connected via UART.
One of the boards would act as the transmitter (encoder), while the other would act as the receiver (decoder).
